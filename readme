# Selenium Twitter Test Bot

## Overview  
**Selenium Twitter Test Bot** is a Python automation script designed for testing Twitter's (X) signup flow. This tool automates the process with human-like interactions and handles all steps except solving CAPTCHA and entering OTP, which require manual intervention.

## Required Files and Configuration  
### 1. `config.json`  
A JSON file to store essential data like email and password. Ensure the file is placed in the specified directory (`src/json/config.json`).

**Example:**
```json
{
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
}
```

### 2. `chromedriver.exe`  
Download ChromeDriver corresponding to your browser version and ensure it is added to your system's PATH. Alternatively, place it in the same directory as the script.

### 3. Manual CAPTCHA and OTP Handling  
This script automates the signup process until the CAPTCHA step or OTP verification, which must be resolved manually:
- CAPTCHA: The automation pauses at CAPTCHA, requiring user input to solve it.
- OTP: Once an OTP is sent to the email or phone number, it needs to be entered manually for verification.

## Features  
- **Configurable Data**: Load email and password dynamically from JSON files.
- **Human-like Behavior**: Randomized delays and realistic typing simulation.
- **Incognito Mode**: Uses Chrome options to prevent cache interference during testing.
- **Anti-Detection Mechanisms**: Spoofing user-agent and disabling Selenium detection.
- **Dynamic Form Handling**: Random name generation and adaptive date of birth selection.
- **Manual Intervention**: Supports pauses to resolve CAPTCHA and enter OTP.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install selenium faker
   ```
3. Place the required `config.json` file in the directory.

## Usage  
1. Update `config.json` with testing credentials.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Manually solve the CAPTCHA when prompted.
4. Enter the OTP sent to the email or phone number for verification.
